As someone who interns full-time at Media.Net, works at LeetCode as a problem setter, serves as a tech advisor for a meditech startup named Simpheal and co-founding crackDSA, I have firsthand experience in managing multiple responsibilities. Here are some tips that have helped me stay on top of my schedule and achieve my goals. It can be challenging to manage it all. However, with proper time management, it's possible to balance multiple commitments and achieve success in each.

#### Create a schedule: 📈
The first step in managing your time effectively is to create a schedule. Having a clear plan for each day, week, and month can help you prioritize your tasks and ensure that you're making the most of your time. For example, I work at Media.Net during the day, at LeetCode during the weekends, attend college only on Thursdays, and work on the startups at night.

#### Prioritize your tasks: 📌
With multiple responsibilities, it's essential to prioritize your tasks and focus on the most important ones first. Consider factors like deadlines, importance, and urgency when determining which tasks to prioritize.

#### Set realistic goals: 🎯
It's essential to set achievable goals for each day, week, and month. This will help you stay motivated and focused on what you need to accomplish.

#### Eliminate distractions: 💯
Whether it's social media, email, or other distractions, it's essential to eliminate anything that takes away from your productivity. Find a quiet space to work or use tools like apps to block distracting websites.

#### Take breaks: 📍
While it's important to be productive, it's equally important to take breaks and give yourself time to recharge. Whether it's taking a walk, reading a book, or simply taking a nap, taking regular breaks can help you stay focused and energized. For example, I go on a 2-3 day trip every month with friends/family etc.

#### Stay organized: 👨🏻‍💻
Keeping your workspace and files organized can help you save time and avoid confusion. Use tools like calendars, to-do lists, and file management systems to keep your tasks and files in order.

#### Delegate tasks: 🚀
If you have the resources, delegate tasks to others to free up time for more important responsibilities. This can help you achieve more in less time and reduce your stress levels.

In conclusion, managing multiple responsibilities can be challenging, but with proper time management, it's possible to achieve success in each. Whether it's interning at a company, working as a problem setter, serving as a tech advisor, or co-founding a startup, prioritizing your tasks, setting achievable goals, eliminating distractions, taking breaks, staying organized, and delegating tasks can help you make the most of your time.

As a superstar once said - "Don't let people say you can't do everything. You can do everything you want."
 
Can you guess the superstar?
